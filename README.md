Data used in monograph published by the University of Michigan Press

<b>This repository</b> contains spreadsheets of the raw data of the morphology and use wear (alteration) of ceramics from Musarna, Populonia, and Cetamura del Chianti. Data collection of Musarna and Populonia was completed in spring 2011, fall 2011, and winter 2012. Data collection at Cetamura del Chianti was completed in the summers of 2014 and 2015.

The theory and methods behind this data collection was published in the <i>Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology</i> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1558/jmea.v27i2.187">2014</a> as well as in a short article in Fautores <i>Acta</i> <a href="https://www.fautores.org/pages/contents_acta_1-44.htm#acta43">2014</a>. 

This data is in .csv files that are appropriate for Excel, SPSS, or any other statistical software. Statistical analysis and subsequent interpretation of the data was completed in SPSS for a 2013 dissertation in the Interdepartmental Program in Classical Art and Archaeology at the University of Michigan and for the monograph <i>Foodways in Roman Republican Italy: changing behaviours and identities</i> (University of Michigan Press 2021).

<b>This repository</b> <b><i>also</i></b> contains three documents of notes on the results of statistical tests performed on this data. For every type of ceramic ware and every morphological form, the same types of tests were run. Each of the tests as reported are easily able to be matched to the relevant chapter and section of the published book, for the curious specialist reader. An explanation of the statistical tests and the decisions behind them can be found in Appendix I of the monograph.
